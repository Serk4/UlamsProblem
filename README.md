# Ulam's Problem
Demonstration of Ulam's Problem series

## Algorithm

1. take any postive, whole number.
2. if value is even, divide by two, else multiply by three and add 1.
3. with result, repeat from 2.

All numbers eventually go into a repeating series 4, 2, 1... This demonstration stops the algorithm when the number reaches 1. 

## Output 

Output is in four columns, 3 numbers and the whole series for each:

1. the test number
2. the count of numbers in the series (i.e., the test number through 1)
3. the highest value in the series
4. the series, the number being tested is on the far right
